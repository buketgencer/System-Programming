# Enhanced Directory Copying Utility (MWCp)

This project, developed for the **CSE 344 System Programming course at Gebze Technical University**, builds upon the multi-threaded directory copying utility **MWCp** from Homework 4. The enhanced version introduces **condition variables** and **barriers** to improve thread synchronization and ensure orderly execution of worker-manager activities. The utility is designed to efficiently copy files and subdirectories in parallel, using POSIX and standard C libraries.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Synchronization**:
  - **Condition Variables**: Used to signal the state of the buffer (empty or full) between manager and worker threads.
  - **Barriers**: Ensure all worker threads synchronize at specific stages of execution.
- **Multi-Threaded Design**:
  - A **manager thread** organizes file paths and adds them to a shared buffer.
  - **Worker threads** fetch file paths from the buffer to perform copying operations.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handles invalid inputs, file descriptor limits, and system errors gracefully.
- **Resource Management**:
  - Implements proper memory and resource cleanup, validated through tools like `valgrind`.
- **Signal Handling**:
  - Gracefully shuts down on `Ctrl+C`, releasing all allocated resources and terminating threads cleanly.

## Improvements Over HW4
1. **Condition Variables**:
   - Enables manager and worker threads to wait and signal each other based on buffer state.
   - Prevents busy waiting, ensuring efficient thread operations.
2. **Barriers**:
   - Ensures all worker threads complete a phase before proceeding, improving synchronization.
3. **Performance Enhancements**:
   - Optimized buffer usage and worker thread coordination for faster directory copying.
4. **Testing**:
   - Includes additional test scenarios to analyze performance with varying buffer sizes and worker counts.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the code using the provided Makefile:
   ```bash
   make


Run the program with the following syntax:
./MWCp <buffer_size> <number_of_workers> <source_directory> <destination_directory>

./MWCp 10 4 ./source ./destination

Testing Scenarios
Test 1: ./MWCp 10 10 ./testdir ./tocopy (buffer size: 10, workers: 10)
Test 2: ./MWCp 10 4 ./testdir ./tocopy (buffer size: 10, workers: 4)
Test 3: ./MWCp 10 100 ./testdir ./tocopy (buffer size: 10, workers: 100)
