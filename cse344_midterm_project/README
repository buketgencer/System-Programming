This project, developed for the CSE 344 System Programming course at Gebze Technical University, implements a concurrent file access system using a client-server architecture. The server forks a new process for each client, manages active connections with a PID array, and ensures data consistency using semaphores and file locking. Clients can connect to the server to upload, download, or modify files. Signal handling is implemented for clean resource management and graceful shutdown. The code is compiled using a Makefile, and the server runs continuously to handle client requests until terminated.
