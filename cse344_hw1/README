# Student Grade Management System

This project, developed for the **CSE 344 System Programming course at Gebze Technical University**, implements a Student Grade Management System using the C programming language. The system allows users to perform various operations, including adding grades, searching for specific student grades, sorting them, and displaying them in an organized manner.

## Key Features
- **Grade Management**: Add, search, sort, and display student grades efficiently.
- **File Operations**: Uses `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `close()` system calls for file management.
- **Concurrent Processing**: Utilizes `fork()` to enable multitasking and improve performance.
- **Logging**: Records all operations in a log file for auditing and debugging.
- **Makefile**: Simplifies compilation and execution with predefined commands.
- **Valgrind Integration**: Ensures memory management stability and detects leaks.

The system is designed to provide a comprehensive platform for managing student grades while demonstrating core system programming concepts such as process creation and inter-process communication.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Use the provided Makefile to compile the project:
   ```bash
